				<h2 id="history">History</h2>
				<p>Founded in 1851, Bank of the Philippine Islands is the first bank in the Philippines and in the Southeast Asian region. BPI is a universal bank and together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, it offers a wide range of financial products and solutions that serve both retail and corporate clients. <br><br>
 
				BPI's services include consumer banking and lending, asset management, payments, insurance, securities brokerage and distribution, foreign exchange, leasing, and corporate and investment banking.<br><br>

				Overseas, we offer diverse value-added services through two banking subsidiaries: BPI International Finance Limited in Hong Kong and Bank of the Philippine Islands (Europe) PLC, which has a head office and a branch in London.<br><br>

				The establishment of BPI, originally known as El Banco Español Filipino de Isabel II, ushered in the birth of the Philippine banking and finance industry. During this period, the bank performed many functions—from providing credit to the National Treasury to printing and issuing currency—effectively making it the country's first Central Bank.<br><br>

				Today, BPI proudly carries on the tradition of reinventing and redefining the country’s economic landscape by financing many private and public sector initiatives and enterprises in support of economic growth and nation building. Our digital banking innovations and commitment to sustainability have helped build a better, more inclusive Philippines.<br><br>

				BPI is acknowledged as a leading provider of financial services and an industry pillar in the Philippines.</p>
